<p>In this video we will see how to make ice cream at home in Tamil. This homemade vanilla ice cream is made without using heavy whipping cream / half and half and without ice cream maker (machine). This is a simple ice cream recipe in which we are only going to use 3 basic ingredients, milk, sugar and eggs. This version of ice cream is made using the custard generated from eggs. Since we are making the ice cream directly from scratch it takes about 40 minutes for milk to reach half the quantity. Also add milk little by little to prevent the eggs from scrambling.  

    Friends we can make ice cream without any artificial flavors and preservatives using this simple method. This basic ice cream doesn't require heavy whipping cream or condensed milk or ice cream maker. Everyone can make this ice cream at home and surprise your friends and family. Also please share your feedback about the recipe in the comments below and happy cooking.
